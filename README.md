## Contents:

- exam-schedule.js: This is actually the .gs script attached as an Apps Script to Google Sheets (saved in .js to get syntax highlighting)
- testSpreadsheet: Textual data for the testing spreadsheet (doens't include formatting)



## Roadmap:

- Correction of color codes to match map of color coes in spreadsheet
- Correction of timetable generation for individual exams (needs slightly more data to be useful and the header row should be skipped)
- Checking Moodle "Group self select" preferences doesn't break the CSV output required for the generate timetable function (if this is the case, maybe a custom Moodle plugin will help?)

## Live test:
Simply go to File -> Make a Copy to get the spreadsheet with the Apps Script from here:
